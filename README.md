# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Internship â€“ Weekly Progress Report (Summer 2025)

This repository contains my work for a 7-week internship focused on implementing foundational machine learning algorithms using Python. Each week explores a different topic through code, visualization, and evaluation using toy datasets.

## ðŸ“… Weekly Breakdown

### âœ… Week 1: NumPy and Matplotlib
- Learned NumPy array creation, indexing, and broadcasting
- Practiced matrix operations and vectorized computations
- Used Matplotlib for line plots, scatter plots, and subplots

### âœ… Week 2: Linear Regression
- Implemented simple linear regression from scratch
- Explored cost function (MSE) and visualized loss surface
- Applied models to 1D and 2D datasets

### âœ… Week 3: Gradient Descent & Overfitting
- Implemented gradient descent algorithm step-by-step
- Tuned learning rate and analyzed convergence
- Studied overfitting and underfitting in regression

### âœ… Week 4: Logistic Regression
- Implemented logistic regression for binary classification
- Trained models using scikit-learn on toy datasets
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

### âœ… Week 5: Naive Bayes
- Learned Bayesâ€™ Theorem and feature independence
- Built Naive Bayes classifier for spam and sentiment analysis
- Preprocessed text using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF

### âœ… Week 6: Decision Trees
- Constructed decision trees using entropy and Gini impurity
- Visualized decision trees using `plot_tree()`
- Discussed pruning and overfitting

### âœ… Week 7: Ensemble Learning
- Applied Bagging and Random Forest for variance reduction
- Implemented AdaBoost and compared model accuracies
- Finalized performance evaluation of all models
